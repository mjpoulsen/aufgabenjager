Aufgabenjäger - the task hunter

## About

Aufgabenjäger is meant to be a fullstack solution for tracking tasks without using a cloud service.

This project was made using this [project](https://github.com/AntonioMaccarini/dockerize-react-node-postgres-nginx-application) as a starting point. It deviates from the source in that it uses Typescript and newer versions of Vite and Docker.

## Stack

- React
- Express JS
- PostgreSQL
- Docker

## Todos

- Ability to create more boards
- Fix due date selector
- Filter tasks
- Reoccuring tasks: daily, monthly, etc.
- Add drizzle ORM?
- Make types more consistent: there are string and number types that change depending upon lookup or display
